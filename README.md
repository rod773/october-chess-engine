# October Chess Engine

A "baby's first" multi-threaded chess engine in Java I developed in
October 2010. It plays a weak game of both classic chess and [gothic
chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capablanca_chess). Some of the more
complicated rules are probably wrong/missing (draws, castling), and it
doesn't support underpromotion.

## Getting started (quick and dirty)

Obtain a JDK, then compile and run:

    $ javac com/nullprogram/chess/Chess.java
    $ java com.nullprogram.chess.Chess
